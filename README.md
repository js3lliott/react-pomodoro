This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a very simple react app of a pomodoro timer. I built this with the help of Chris on Code (https://learn.chrisoncode.io/courses/make-20-react-apps).
I'm an absolute beginner when it comes to developing applications in React and this was a very usefult tutorial.

Key components of the app include making use of react states (useState()), and react refs (useRef()) as well as creating parent and child components.
